## How it Works
 Make a Weather Dashboard

 Includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. 

 Clicking on the city name performs a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.

Includes a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast displays the following:

1 Date

2 Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)

3 Temperature

4 Humidity
